## About
This repository serves as a learning log for my journey to master DSA. It includes C++ programs for practicing basic concepts and working with arrays. Each solution is well-structured and aims to solve common algorithmic problems.

---

## Topics Covered
### **1. Basics of C++**
- Input/Output operations
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Functions and basic problem-solving

### **2. Arrays**
- Initialization and traversal
- Operations like searching and sorting
- Solved problems:
  - Find the largest element in an array
  - Reverse an array
  - Search for an element in an array
